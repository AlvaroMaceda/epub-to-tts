## Installation (from PyPI)

To install the package from PyPI, run:

```sh
pip install epub-to-tts
```

Or use any provided CLI entry points (if defined in `pyproject.toml`).

## CLI Usage

After installing from PyPI, you can use the following commands:

- Generate audiobook:
  ```sh
  epub-to-tts <audiobook.epub> [--voice <voice>] [--rate <rate>] [--pitch <pitch>] [--volume <volume>] [--start-chapter <n>] [--end-chapter <n>]
  ```

  - `<audiobook.epub>`: Path to your EPUB file (required)
  - `--voice`: Voice for TTS (optional, default: `en-US-JennyNeural`)
  - `--rate`: Speech rate (optional, e.g. `+20%`)
  - `--pitch`: Speech pitch (optional, e.g. `+5Hz`)
  - `--volume`: Speech volume (optional, e.g. `+10dB`)
  - `--start-chapter`: Start from this chapter number (starts by 1) Optional, default is 1
  - `--end-chapter`: End at this chapter number (the chapter is included) Optional, default is the last chapter


- List available voices:
  ```sh
  epub-to-tts-list-voices
  ```

These commands are available as entry points defined in `pyproject.toml` and will work after installing the package with pip.


All audio files will be saved in the `audio_chapters` folder.
